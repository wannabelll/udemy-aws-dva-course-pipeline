To run locally:
1) Upload code into your machine:
   https://github.com/wannabelll/Django-pet.git
2) You must install python and PIP on your system:
   python --version
   pip --version
3) Create a virtual environment for project:
   Windows:
     python -m venv myworld
   Unix/MacOS:
     python -m venv myworld
This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named "myworld" with subfolders and files, like this:
myworld
  Include

  Scripts
  pyvenv.cfg
4) Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:
  Windows:
    myworld\Scripts\activate.bat 
  Unix/MacOS:
    source myworld/bin/activate
5) Install dependencies from "requirements.txt" file:
    pip install -r .\my_team\requirements.txt

   python .\my_team\manage.py runserver
